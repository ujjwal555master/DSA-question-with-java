Question-6 :- https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-interview-150


Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).


#code:-
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int k = 0; // Pointer for the position to place non-val elements
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[k] = nums[i]; // Move the non-val element to the front
                k++; // Increment the position
            }
        }
        
        return k; // k is the count of non-val elements
    }
}
